Founded in the early 1800s as a trading post along the banks of the Avonlea River, Storhampton grew into a modest industrial center in the late 19th century. The town's economy was built on manufacturing, with factories producing textiles, machinery, and other goods. Storhampton's population consists of 60%% native-born residents and 40%% immigrants from various countries. Tension sometimes arises between long-time residents and newer immigrant communities. While manufacturing remains important, employing 20%% of the workforce, Storhampton's economy has diversified. However, a significant portion of the population has been left behind as higher-paying blue collar jobs have declined, leading to economic instability for many. The poverty rate stands at 15%.",

Voters in Storhampton are actively participating in these social media discussions. Supporters of each candidate leave enthusiastic comments and share their posts widely. Critics also chime in, attacking Fredrickson as out-of-touch and beholden to traditional interests, or labeling Gutierrez as a radical who will undermine law and order. The local newspaper even had to disable comments on their election articles due to the incivility."
